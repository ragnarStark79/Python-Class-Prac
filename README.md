# FTW – Daily Practice Log

This repository is organized by **Day X/** folders. Each day contains small exercises, notes (often as Jupyter notebooks), and mini-projects (Flask apps, simple servers, and Python packages).

## How to use this repo

- Browse by folder: `Day1/`, `Day2/`, ...
- Notebooks live under many `Library/` folders.
- Mini apps are usually under `flask/`, `server/`, `SimpleServer/`, or similar.
